<p>  While reading the article "404 Page Not Found" by Kate Wagner and evaluating the word choice and how the author had constructed the article I found this article very informative on the evolution of the web. However, I had to disagree with some of the points that  Wagner had mentioned about the current UI and design/interface of social media pages. Wagner mentions many times in the article her distaste for the modern interfaces and her likings for the ‘older internet’: </p>

<p><em>“But the thrill of making and discovering sites is not the same. The analogue organicism of finding something is no longer there—these were sites you “stumbled upon” (Kate Wagner, 2019). 

<p>“As for customization, it’s even worse: I can’t change how Twitter or Facebook looks on my phone” (Kate Wagner, 2019). </p>

<p>“companies these days don’t bother wasting time on mobile browsing. They prefer to nag us into “downloading the app” (Kate Wagner, 2019).</p> 

<p>“Because websites had to either become apps or self-optimize for mobile, web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to become flat, highly minimalistic, and multi-platform, and the results are, frankly, fucking boring” (Kate Wagner, 2019). </p>

<p>“The scene of this struggle between the hideous-beautiful old internet and the cleanly if ungodly 2.0 variety played out in the mid-2000s, a transitional period that saw the first stirrings of the consolidated social media net we endure today” (Kate Wagner, 2019). </p>

<p>“The critique offered by vaporwave—its defiant sense of utopia—was immediately and effectively erased, leaving only a commodified, nostalgic aesthetic. And this aesthetic detritus, its millennial pink, Memphis-esque shapes and squiggles made entirely for Instagram, became cold, devoid of joy and playfulness” (Kate Wagner, 2019). </p> 

<p>“It’s about time for a little revenge from the old internet. Or how about revenge from the older, older internet: communism” (Kate Wagner, 2019). </em> </p>

<p>Wagner applies well to her quote of “Nostalgia, I’m reminded, is profitable—it remains one of the easiest to execute and cheapest grifts of neoliberal culture” (Kate Wagner, 2019).  

This was a statement I could agree with too, but as a 19-year-old who has been internet browsing since the early 2010’s, I disagree on her distaste for the modern layouts of webpages and internet browsing.  

The modern minimalistic style of web interfaces is much easier and understandable to the User who might not be so savvy with navigating the web. The style also relieves the eyes of the user by sorting URL’s by most relevant and useful when seeking information which may be harder to use when searching for something very specific it still caters to the wider audience seeking quick information.  

A good portion of Wagner’s main points highlights how the User isn't as free to do as much customization: </p>

<p> <em>“The assumption that the attributes of Myspace were the sole domain of the tween doesn’t fit at all with the truth; many former users still care about these glittery sites because they were able to make them truly their own. When Blingee, a glitter gif-making website and community, announced it was shutting down in 2015 so that the company could launch a mobile app project, the backlash was striking—down to users’ testimonials about what the site meant for them. The outpouring caused Blingee to reevaluate its business model, and the site is still up to this day” </p>

<p>“As for customization, it’s even worse: I can’t change how Twitter or Facebook looks on my phone” (Kate Wagner, 2019).</p> 

<p>“The scene of this struggle between the hideous-beautiful old internet and the cleanly if ungodly 2.0 variety played out in the mid-2000s, a transitional period that saw the first stirrings of the consolidated social media net we endure today” (Kate Wagner, 2019). </em> </p>

<p>Complimented with the funky-nostalgic art provided before reading the article I’ve concluded that Wagner misses the early 2000’s-2010 interfaces and customization of the internet and hopes for more of an older internet feel. </p>

<p> I personally can see appeals to both sides she addressed (the older and newer internet). I can acknowledge and appreciate the diverse, customizable and funkiness the interfaces the 'old internet' use to provide but I personally have a liking towards how pages are set up now in terms of convenience and eye-strain. I believe there's a place for anyone on the web these days and people who miss that side of the internet can still satisfy their creativity and nostalgia by browsing in the modern day. </p>
