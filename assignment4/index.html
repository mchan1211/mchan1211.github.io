  		"Some days when I'm down, just a little bit, I drop myself to the floor
It's not a problem if it hurts because I can't feel ache anymore, I
Only came back home because I wanted to see what's changed
And when I realized everyone's gone, but I still feel the same, I
Wasn't meant to be
This bored at <b>nineteen</b>(...) Wasn't meant to be
This bored at <b>nineteen</b>
My friend lived next to me
Now she won't want to see
Me look differently
Now that I'm <b>nineteen</b>"

	<p>'“Nineteen” was recorded in 2021, and is about how PinkPanthress feels disconnected from her friends and family, who’ve all changed and she no longer connects to anyone. 
This song has never been performed live, likely as it is very personal."'<a href="https://genius.com/Pinkpantheress-nineteen-lyrics"/a>Genius Annotation</a></p>
