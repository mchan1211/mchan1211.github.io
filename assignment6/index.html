				 There is a beast that resides in you. It scratches at your skin and asks you: What does it mean to be here? What does it mean to be me? What does it mean to be true?

Existentialism is often painted as morbid and unforgiving in its depressing ideals. The truth is that while the philosophy seems to centre the anguish of existence and its meaninglessness, it is also a source of salvation. To be an existentialist is to investigate and tear apart the ideals that have been brought upon us, to identify that there is an issue with existence and how to design essence for ourselves. It is because the universe is meaningless, we have the freedom to birth this essence ourselves: that is the beauty of Existentialism.

In Evangelion, the issue of existentialism is brought forward with artistic passion. The director, Hideaki Anno orchestrates religious symbols, mecha fighting robots, and cyberpunk animation to create a narrative that brings power to the anguish of existence. Evangelion is set in a post-apocalyptic world after a cataclysmic event called the Second Impact. In a world after the Second Impact, human existence is threatened by Angels which aim to trigger the Third Impact. These Angels are to be defeated by Evas which are “mechanical humanoids” that are piloted by 14-year-old teenagers.

			  <h1>My Reponse</h1>
			  <p>
				 Throughout my college expirience Ive gone through many episodes of 'what if' and 'whys'. During my english class we had to do an essay response to Neon Genesis Evangelion and I was pleased to pick up and rewatch this anime. The art and many messages this show protrays on different philosophys and traumas was very reflective and informative.
