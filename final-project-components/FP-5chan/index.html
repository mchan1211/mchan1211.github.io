	<p> At 5chan, we believe that the internet should be a space for connection, creativity, and  constructive discourse. However, as we navigate the online landscape, our culture experts  find it crucial to recognize how our behaviors contribute to the pervasive culture of hate  and division and how we may even be doing it unknowingly and hurting ourselves. We  encourage our viewers to question their own online interactions and consider the  implications of their digital footprints.</p>

          >You consider yourself a introvert, being around social energy all the time is draining and  boring. Being at home and preserving your peace and energy sounds like a hell of a night to  you.    <br><br>

>You decide to go to a party your roommate invites you to. 

>All night you’re just blasted with Maroon 5 ‘Sugar’ and Drake ‘Gods plan’, You  immediately regret even coming here, why be around an environment where pop songs  from 5-9 years ago are being played like a trip to a FOREVER21?
  <br><br>

 >No one understands what taste really is anymore, everyone and their ripped jeans and  sweatshirts combos.. all ‘NPCs’..

 Engaging in ‘NPC’ behavior. Its no doubt touching your phone every hour of the day since you have awoken is not that  uncommon anymore. It might even be the first thing you pick up. 
You go on social media  and give your brain that sprinkle of dopamine by seeing content you generally enjoy or you interact with. 

>You wake up on a Thursday before attending work/class and that’s when you see it, the  trend, the song, the outfit, the skincare, the dance, the meme. It was funny and interesting  the first few times you saw it a few weeks ago but now recycled and overused mediums  were being made. A feeling of annoyance washes over you, seeing this type of content for  the 25th time! This content’s comments and likes stayed a bit consistent since you have  first seen it with some new eyes on it, giving it praise and laughter. Seeing this material  gives you discomfort and annoyance before you have even left your bed. How could anyone find this amusing anymore? These common people must know nothing.  Its like seeing a baby being amused by a simple game of Peek-a-Boo, or a mother laughing  at a minions meme that has a ‘but first, coffee’ reference.
All of these people are  simpletons, simple titles to their name and no depth, all printed slightly alternating copies. Yet as you put down your phone and gradually get yourself out of bed, you start your mornings downing the same cup of brown bean water, cooking lunch whilst scrolling on  Youtube or Tiktok;giving out a few comments and likes, going grocery shopping, coming home from school/work and then laying in bed whilst scrolling once again, its the end of  the day, you have time to finally relax right?
 What makes your neighbor different from you?
The more you’re exposed to on the internet? your knowledge about what’s ‘trending’ or  ‘outdated’? Is your style different? You couldn’t have been the first to have that same outfit  coordination, maybe it was from your favorite punk band, just inspiration of course.
What  makes you different from your neighbor? 
You can recognize these trends and see what the  majority of people find interesting to share and talk about. Does that mean you’re a greater  human being?

 You’re the problem, Metaphysical Solipsism: Metaphysical solipsism states that “only my  mind truly exists; in other words, I exist, and everything else is merely a product of my  thoughts or imagination.” Other realities, including the external world and other persons are representations of that  self, having no independent existence. You dislike ‘Mob Mentality’ just the idea of people band-wagoning on something they do  not have much depth about is distasteful to you.
   <br><br>

What you’re experiencing is yourself..
  <br><br>

experiencing thyself.. experiencing itself.. 
  <br><br>

experiencing you,
  <br><br>

its not that you ‘hate it’, you see how ‘played out’ it is and then you think other people think  its played out, so you dont want other people to think you’re victim to the common  culture/collective; other people think its ‘played out’ because other people think its played  out. you’re embracing and brainwashed into Western culture individualism. 
  <br><br>

Are you the NPC?.
