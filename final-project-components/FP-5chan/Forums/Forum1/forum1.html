I’m reaching out because I’m really struggling with shifting my husband’s and my children’s tastes. I fear this family has gone down a unhealthy pipeline due to me not cooking more nourishing whole foods in the past, I feel as if they resent me more and more with each plate I set down and declining their badgerings to get food by the passing Mcdonalds. I am doing this out of lov..</p>

        <p class="post-content">“A study conducted by The American Heart Association (2016) found that adults, particularly those with families or demanding jobs, often feel too busy to commit to regular workouts.”  I use to think I had no time to stop and working out after my 9-5 at retail. I would go home and down some take-away that was near my complex. Little did I know my lack of activity and diet was one of the biggest issues with energy levels. I always looked in the mirror and believed my body was just incapable of changing.That was until I had joined the Fitness Group on 5chan and turned off my feelings and social media. I now have the energy and mindset to get out of this 15 year career rut ive been in. Ive decided, even though im still working at this terrible job, Things can change for me and im much more capable of what my mind tells me other wise.  I have the proof in the pudding of what hard work can do! Im  more lean and balanced, im more confi..</p>

        <p class="post-content">Every time I run, I’m sore the next day (sometimes even two days later). I understand that muscle soreness is normal, but I think it's starting to get in my head. It's discouraging when I’m feeling stiff and achy and it starts to make me dread the next run. I’ve tried stretching before and after, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Is there somethin g I’m missing here, like a specific recovery technique or supplement? “ A study from The Journal of Sports Psychology (2015) suggested that music is preferred by many runners because of its ability to boost performance, energy, and mood. However, those who enjoy learning, storytelling, or deep thinking may prefer podcasts, especially for longer, more leisurely runs where performance isn't the primary goal”; Should I listen to music or a podcast?</p>
