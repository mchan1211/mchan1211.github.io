I just wanted to share something personal that's been a game-changer (hahahha im terrible) for me. Recently, I decided to take a break from my phone and social media, and even all of my video games and honestly, I didn’t expect the results to be this profound! The results have been AMAZING. Here’s what happened..</p>

        <p class="post-content">I’m going through something right now that I’m really struggling to make sense of, and I could really use some advice or perspective from others who might have been through something similar.
For the past few years, I’ve been holding onto certain beliefs that I thought were absolute, my moral compass locked in a rigid set of right and wrong (such as women wearing bras, and how the sexual revolution culture has ‘messed up’ modern women . I’ve always prided myself on being "good" and "righteous" in the way I approach things, whether it’s politics, personal relationships, or even just how I present myself online.

For so long, I was plugged into the cycle of constant feeds, outrage, echo chambers, and arguments. I thought I was doing the right thing by aligning with what I believed to be moral or just, but when I disconnected and had time to reflect, I realized how narrow-minded and judgmental I had been.

        <p class="post-content">Panda Dunks.. the most hated shoe at my school. Walk into class with those on and you will immediately be labeled as ‘Basic’ or people wil give you the look of ‘how did this man get in here’ Ive found this video that I wish I could honestly project at my school, sadly there are no meeting or typical rallies just boujee fashion shows. As a streetwear enjoyer and just someones who is more into casual wear.. this video projects all of my emotions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP5sWeQRSNA&list=PLvHg8m7QjgBF6oDs5AU4mwK6MdravDHUm"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP5sWeQRSNA&list=PLvHg8m7QjgBF6oDs5AU4mwK6MdravDHUm </a>
According to a 2021 survey from the American College Health Association (ACHA), 60% of college students reported feeling "overwhelmed" by all they had to do, and 40% reported experiencing anxiety in the past year.
